Hi, I'm Larri!
I am an incoming Communication PhD student with my M.S. in DACSS and a B.A. in Cognitive Science and Psychology. My research interest is primarily in disinformation flow via social media; more generally, I am interested in the intersection of media, technology, and society. I am from DuBois, Pennsylvania, and I currently live in Amherst, MA with my bunny Cleo!
