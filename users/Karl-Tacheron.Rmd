## Bio

I am an incoming student to the Geosciences department's Geography MS program. I hold a BFA in Photography from MassArt. 
My favorite place to be is on a bicycle far from where the Google Street View cameras have reached. 
I am from Ipswich, Massachusetts, and have lived in Boston MA, Western MA, Brooklyn NY, Northern Virginia, and Santa Fe, NM.
