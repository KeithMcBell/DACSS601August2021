Hi, I'm Erin!
I am an incoming DACSS UWW student with my B.S. in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences and Early Childhood Education from James Madison University. I work for the Massachusetts Teachers Association. My research interest is primarily in comparing teacher salaries/benefits across comparative districts, and other research related to union negotiations. I am from Warner NH, but now live in Wakefield, MA with my husband and 4 year old son, Mitchell.
