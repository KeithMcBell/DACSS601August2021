Below is a scatter plot of 250 randomly generated data points.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#set seed to reproduce results
set.seed(327)
#randomly generate 250 int from 1-100
X <- sample.int(100, 250, replace=TRUE) 
#randomly generate 250 int from 1-100
Y <- sample.int(100, 250, replace=TRUE)
#scatter plot of X, Y
plot(X, Y, xlab="X Samples", ylab="Y Samples",
     pch = 16, col = "red")
```
