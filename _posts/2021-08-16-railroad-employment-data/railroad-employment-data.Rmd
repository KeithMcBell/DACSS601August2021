  ```{r setup}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
State_county <- read_excel("../../_data/StateCounty2012.xls", skip=3)
```

The data has been read in. Let's see how it looks like -

```{r}
head(State_county)
tail(State_county)
```

This needs further cleaning to make it suitable for further analysis.

```{r}
State_county <- select(State_county, -c(2, 4))
State_county <- State_county[complete.cases(State_county),]
head(State_county)
tail(State_county)
```

This looks much better!
